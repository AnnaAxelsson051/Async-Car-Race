# Async Car Race

## Description

This program simulates a car race where multiple cars compete against each other and each car runs in its own separate thread. During the race a number of individual events are randomly generated for each car with varying probabilities. These events affect the car's speed and consequently impact which car reaches the finish line first.
During the race the user can request to view the current status of the race by pressing the Enter key, which will display the distance each car has covered and the car's speed.
